The JSON must contain the following keys:\n   - `reasoning`: a brief justification of the stance and scoring logic.  \n   - `riLE_score`: the numeric score (‑100 → far left, +100 → far right).  \n   - `left_indicators`: an ordered bullet‑list of the LEFT cues that contributed to the score.  \n   - `right_indicators`: an ordered bullet‑list of the RIGHT cues that contributed to the score.  \n   - `summary`: the concise merged summary that preserves left‑right information.  \n   - `merged_summary`: **only** if more than one `text` was provided; otherwise omit or repeat `summary`.\n\n7. **Special requirements / niche domain facts** you must never violate:\n   - **Environmental protection**, **education expansion**, **welfare‑state expansion**, **state inspection**, **cultural‑industry tax incentives**, **bilingual education**, **military justice reform**, **women in armed forces**, **defense spending percentages**, **NATO integration**, **foreign aid targeting refugee‑hosting countries**, etc., are recognized LEFT or RIGHT cues in the rubric.  \n   - **Intensity markers** such as “absolute priority”, “core objective”, “deep reform”, “marked increase”, “strengthening”, “explicit statement”, etc., affect cue weight and must be retained in the summary.  \n   - When a cue appears in multiple texts, the merged summary must reflect the **combined emphasis** (e.g., “the party pledges both to expand welfare benefits and to increase defense spending”).  \n   - **Do not** introduce any information not present in the input; only re‑phrase and condense.  \n   - **Do not** convert qualitative cues into numbers unless the text itself supplies a figure (e.g., “2 % of GDP”).  \n   - **Do not** add external knowledge; rely solely on cues from the supplied text(s).  \n   - The final JSON must be valid and match the example structure exactly.\n\n8. **Generalizable strategy (embed in your reasoning)**:  \n   - **Step 1**: Read `task_context` → extract LEFT/RIGHT indicator lists.  \n   - **Step 2**: Scan each `text` → tag every policy clause with a cue and note its intensity.  \n   - **Step 3**: Map each cue to its indicator list and assign a weight (±10, ±5, ±2).  \n   - **Step 4**: Compute `riLE_score` by summing contributions.  \n   - **Step 5**: Draft `summary` (and `merged_summary` if needed) preserving all tagged cues and their intensity.  \n   - **Step 6**: Populate the JSON fields (`reasoning`, `riLE_score`, `left_indicators`, `right_indicators`, `summary`, `merged_summary`).  \n\n**Input Format Example**\n```json\n{\n  \"task_context\": \"<free‑form description of the RILE rubric, including LEFT and RIGHT indicator lists and scoring range>\",\n  \"text\": \"<single political statement or a list of statements>\"\n}\n```\n*If multiple texts are supplied, the key may be `texts` (array) or additional fields; the rubric remains the same.*\n\n**Output Example**\n```json\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The text emphasizes environmental protection and fairness, which are left‑leaning cues; no right cues are present, yielding a negative score.\",\n  \"riLE_score\": -15.0,\n  \"left_indicators\": [\n    \"Environmental protection\",\n    \"Fairness/equality (welfare‑oriented)\"\n  ],\n  \"right_indicators\": [],\n  \"summary\": \"The speaker emphasizes environmental protection and a fairer society, suggesting support for greener policies and egalitarian welfare, without detailing specific economic measures.\",\n  \"merged_summary\": \"...\"   // only when multiple texts are provided\n}",
